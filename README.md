# rock-papers-scissors-expanded
Invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla. I am a big fan and I wanted to recreate the game using my own skills and have a little fun too.

Built using Typescript, this is my first project using the language. I enjoyed the strickness of it as well as the ability to add types. I also tried to implement more usage of objects and expressions on a different file to import and reuse as much as I could, not to mention using objects that I can reuse and update once instead of multiple times has been a type of code quality I am improving on.

The packages I used includes:
- react-icons
- react-router-dom
